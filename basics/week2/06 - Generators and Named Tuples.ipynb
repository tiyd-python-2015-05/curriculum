    "How this works may still be unclear - that's because it's iterating through the sequence `lazily`.  This means instead of moving through a sequence all at once the generator will iterate and calculate the value only when it's asked to - waiting until the very last minute before it has to do any work.  Hence the `lazy` term.  This is more clearly demonstrated below."

Your own personal useage of `next` may vary in projects but it serves a good purpose to demonstrate what's going on here."
